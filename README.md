## Cloning Airbnb using Python, Django, tailwind and more.. ✈️🏠

### create virtual environment

mkdir "project folder"  
cd "project folder"  
pipenv --three (install python 3)  
code . (we can see pipfile which is like package.json)  
pipenv shell (go inside the virtual environment)  
pipenv install Django==2.2.5 (install django)  
Django-admin (we could check if its installed)  

django-admin startproject config (create django config files)  
put config folder and manage.py outside  


> python is runtime language, not compiler.  
 so, it cannot check errors before programs start.  
the solution is linter!
